# Turtle Pong

This repository hosts the source code for the ROS turtle_pong package, which implements the auto-Pong arcade video game for the Robot Operating System using Turtlesim.

## Usage

To use the `turtle_pong` package, clone this repository into the `src` folder of your catkin workspace:

```console
fjp@ubuntu:/home/fjp/catkin_ws/src$ git clone https://github.com/fjp/ros-turtle-pong.git
```

Then build the workspace with `catking-tools` or `catkin_make` and source the new package:

```console
# catkin-tools:
fjp@ubuntu:/home/fjp/catkin_ws$ catkin build
# or use
fjp@ubuntu:/home/fjp/catkin_ws$ catkin_make
# source your workspace using the setup.bash or setup.zsh depending on your shell
fjp@ubuntu:/home/fjp/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash
fjp@ubuntu:/home/fjp/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.zsh
```

Finally, start `roscore`, run `turtlesim` and `pong.launch`:

```console
roscore
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
roslaunch turtle_pong pong.launch
```

Note that each of the three commands above should be executed from another terminal so that it will run in its own process.

The game can be played with the w/s keys and the up/down arrow keys to control the left and right player (turtle), respectively.
